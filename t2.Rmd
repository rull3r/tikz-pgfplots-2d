#### `Packages`

Let's remember that $\LaTeX$ is a set of $\TeX$ instructions, therefore, we need to know some things before starting, in this way, we need to define how we like to work

#### `In the Cloud`

A very popular option for beginners in LaTeX is the option to use the cloud, the best platform today is [OverLeaf](www.overleaf.com), it has its own tutorials, thousands of templates, you can work as a team with other editors in latex, among many other positive things that Cloud technology offers us

#### `Local Environment`

Depending on your operating system, the way to install $\LaTeX$ may vary, however, we will always need to download and install all the packages to be able to use LaTeX. Currently there is a basic version and a full version.

Later, we should install an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), to work in a more friendly way, since the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Integrated_development_environment) that comes by default is quite archaic and may not be liked by everyone, in my opinion, the one that I like the most and that I have always used is [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) another one that is has become quite popular is the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/) , which I must admit is good, but in my opnion, I do not recommend it since, although it promises to write documents in [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) format, it has its technical disadvantages, since it hides many of the most powerful features that the environment $\LaTeX$ offers and therefore, you will not know what happens behind the scenes.

I will leave you here a [List of Editors of $\TeX$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors) with each of the characteristics

#### `PDF`

One of the ultimate goals is to be able to create your precious [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF). Thus, it may seem obvious but you also need a [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) reader.

#### `References`

For more advanced users (or for more elaborate documents) we have tools for the use of references, one of the most famous is [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/). Tthe aforementioned tool allows us to generate, save, update and document our references, however, in order for Latex to be able to use it properly, we will need to include some of the LaTeX libraries that exist for handling and formatting references in the final [PDF](https:/ /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF).

#### `Other`

Many people don't know it but Latex can generate other types of files such as [.ps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript), for the latter we have [GPL Ghostscript and GSview](http://pages .cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/). and there is also [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/index.html.es) which is a very simple program to make images directly in [.eps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Encapsulated_PostScript)

#### `Operating Systems`
Obviously latex packages are available for all operating systems

Let's begin to install each of the tools to correctly use $\LaTeX$ in [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)

For this operating system there is [`MikTeX`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiKTeX)

**Step 1)** Download through this [link](https://miktex.org/download). I recommend the basic 64 bits version, since it contains everything we need
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("t2_files/figure-html/fig9.png")
```

**Step 2)** We proceed with the installation, which is quite standard, we just have to take into account that at one point it will ask you if we want to install the packages directly from the cloud, to which we proceed affirmatively, and then we continue with ``next'' .

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width = '35%'}
knitr::include_graphics("t2_files/figure-html/gif1.gif")
```

**Step 3)** Downloading the [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), the one I will use is [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/), for this, we go to this [link ](https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio/releases/download/4.2.0/texstudio-4.2.0-win-qt6.exe)
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width = '35%'}
knitr::include_graphics("t2_files/figure-html/fig16.png")
```
**Step 4)** Installation is even easier (although Windows alarms may throw you a warning, but don't worry, it's just protocol), as it is shown below:
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width = '35%'}
knitr::include_graphics("t2_files/figure-html/gif2.gif")
```

**Step 5)** We are going to check our installation, we are going to use a small piece of code to generate a basic pdf

```{}
\documentclass{article} % Starts an article
\usepackage{amsmath} % Imports amsmath
\title{\LaTeX} % Title

\begin{document} % Begins a document
  \maketitle
  \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for
  the \TeX{} typesetting program. It offers
  programmable desktop publishing features and
  extensive facilities for automating most
  aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing,
  including numbering and  cross-referencing,
  tables and figures, page layout,
  bibliographies, and much more. \LaTeX{} was
  originally written in 1984 by Leslie Lamport
  and has become the  dominant method for using
  \TeX; few people write in plain \TeX{} anymore.
  The current version is \LaTeXe.

  % This is a comment, not shown in final output.
  % The following shows typesetting  power of LaTeX:
  \begin{align}
    E_0 &= mc^2 \\
    E &= \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \end{align} 
\end{document}
```
Copy this code and create a blank sheet, paste the code on the file and then press `F5` button to generate our PDF.
```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("t2_files/figure-html/gif3.gif")
```
If we can see the compiled document on our right, then everything is fine, if not, if you have some errors, you can send me a message. I will not focus too much on the use of the IDE because it's really quite common: Create new document, compile, delete document, save, etc.

Let's start installing each of the tools to correctly use $\LaTeX$ on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). The use of the terminal in this type of operating system can give the impression that it is even more complex to install programs, however, in my opinion, it is way easier. If you are a frequent user of these operating systems, I suppose you know that their installation methods usually vary, I will only focus on the four methods that I consider that they are mostly used. To proceed with the verification, we proceed as explained in the Windows slides

For [Debian ](https://www.debian.org/index.en.html) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/):

```{}
# apt-get update
# apt-get install texlive texlive-base
```
If you want the full $\LaTeX$ package run (Muchos GB de paquetes)
```{}
# apt-get install texlive-full
```

[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/):
```{}
# yum install texlive texlive-latex
```
[ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/):
```{}
# pacman -S texlive-most
```
for installing [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) in [Debian ](https://www.debian.org/index.en.html) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/):
```{}
# apt-get install texstudio
```
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) and [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/) respectively:
```{}
# yum install texstudio
```

```{}
# pacman -S texstudio
```
